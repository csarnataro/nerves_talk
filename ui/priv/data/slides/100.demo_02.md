# Demo 1: Blink a LED <small>(a.k.a. _Hello World_ of embedded device)</small>

* Blink morse code

* Pain points

    1. manually plugging the SD card, `mix firmware` and `mix firmware.burn` take some time \
        Possible mitigation: there's an `upload.sh` script which can update the firmware
        without removing the SD card 

    2. when you `ssh` into your device, the ssh key changes and you have to refresh it 
        with `ssh-keygen -R nerves.local`
