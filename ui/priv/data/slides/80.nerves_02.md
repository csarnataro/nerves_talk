# Get started with Nerves

Not immediate &#128577;, you may need:

* Raspberry PI (or similar)

* Micro SD Card

* Some software (e.g. to flash the SD card)

* Some hardware (LEDs, sensors, wires, breadboard) and, possibly, do some iron soldering?)

* Get familiar with embedded systems jargon and datasheets

Once you're ready, experiment with your HW and **Livebook**
