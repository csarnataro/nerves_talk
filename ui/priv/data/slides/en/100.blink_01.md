# Some pain points 

- Manually plugging the SD card, `mix firmware` and `mix firmware.burn` take some time \
        Possible mitigation: there's an `upload.sh` script which can update the firmware
        without removing the SD card 

- When you `ssh` into your device, the ssh key changes and you have to refresh it 
        with `ssh-keygen -R nerves.local`
