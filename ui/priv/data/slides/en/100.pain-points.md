# Pain points 

* Manually plugging the SD card, `mix firmware` and `mix firmware.burn` take some time

  * you can use an `upload.sh` script to update the firmware
        without removing the SD card 
  * **NervesHub** is a service for over-the-air (OTA) updates \
        **Warning**: never tried, but looks promising 

* When you create a new firmware with `firmware.burn`, the ssh key changes 
        and you have to refresh it 
        with `ssh-keygen -R nerves.local`
