# Nerves and embedded systems

* **Nerves** is an open-source platform that combines the rock-solid BEAM virtual machine and Elixir ecosystem to easily build and deploy 
  production embedded systems _(from nerves-project.org)_.

* Traditionally embeddes systems are programmed in low-level languages like: 
   _Bare metal_, Assembly, C/C++ and more recently Rust/Zig
