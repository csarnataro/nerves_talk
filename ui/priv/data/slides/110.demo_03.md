# Demo 1: Blink a LED  (3)

Pain points:

1. `mix firmware` and `mix firmware.burn`  might require some time and some manual activity. \
    Possible mitigation: there's an `upload.sh` script which can update the firmware
    without removing the SD card

1. when you `ssh` into your device, the ssh key changes and you have to refresh it 
    with `ssh-keygen -R nerves.local`
