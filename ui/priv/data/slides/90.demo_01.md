# Demo 1: Blink a LED <small>(a.k.a. _Hello World_ of embedded device)</small>

Steps (assuming Elixir and `mix` are already installed):

```sh
$ mix archive.install hex nerves_bootstrap #installs nerves generators
$ mix nerves.new hello_nerves #creates new project
$ cd hello_nerves
$ export MIX_TARGET=rpi0
$ mix deps.get
~~~  # after you modify your elixir code
$ mix firmware # builds the firmware for MIX_TARGET, i.e. rpi0
$ mix firmware.burn # burns your firmware on an SD card
```
