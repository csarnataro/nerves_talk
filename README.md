Temporary solution to launch Ecto migrationÂ on the device:

1. ssh into device with `ssh nerves.local`

2. launch
    ```elixir
    path = Application.app_dir(:ui, "priv/repo/migrations")
    Ecto.Migrator.run(Ui.Repo, path, :up, all: true)
    ```

## `sudo` with asdf

sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" MIX_TARGET=rpi0 mix burn

sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" MIX_TARGET=rpi0 mix do deps.get, compile, firmware && ./upload.sh nerves.local
